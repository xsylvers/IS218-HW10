## Summary

This assignment taught me a lot about building and testing a secure REST API. I learned how API endpoints work, how they interact with a database, and how to manage everything using Docker. Running and writing tests with pytest was a key part of the project, as it helped me ensure the API worked as expected while increasing test coverage. Debugging issues like username and password validation or handling tricky profile updates gave me hands-on experience in solving real problems, making the API more reliable and provided hands-on opportunities to trace execution flows. I learned how to interpret error messages better and apply solutions that ultimately strengthen API's relability and security.

I also got to practice using Git more by using version control, creating branches, tracking issues, and using pull requests which made it easier for me to organize everything. Writing clear documentation for the issues I solved and updating the README helped me understand how important good communication is in software development projects. The process of addressing real-world scenarios and edge cases not only refined my problem-solving abilities but also underscored the significance of thorough testing and detailed documentation. Overall, this assignment gave me a better understanding of how to build and test APIs and showed me how knowing this knowledge can be really valuable to yourself in future professional work environments.
