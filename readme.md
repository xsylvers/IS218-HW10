## Summary

This assignment taught me a lot about building and testing a secure REST API. I learned how API endpoints work, how they interact with a database, and how to manage everything using Docker. Running and writing tests with pytest was a key part of the project, as it helped me ensure the API worked as expected while increasing test coverage. Debugging issues like username and password validation or handling tricky profile updates gave me hands-on experience in solving real problems and making the API more reliable.

I also got to practice using Git more by creating branches, tracking issues, and using pull requests which made it easier for me to organize everything. Writing clear documentation for the issues I solved and updating the README helped me understand how important good communication is in software development projects. Overall, this assignment gave me a better understanding of how to build and test APIs and showed me the valueable this knowldege thorough testing.
